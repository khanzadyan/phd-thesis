# Abstract

In this thesis I present an investigation of the manifestations of star formation in different sites. The thesis consists of three major parts in which observations, analysis and the interpretation of contrasting kinds of objects are described. In each case, the technique of near-infrared imaging is used in order to understand  the interaction of outflows with the various kinds of environment.

**Firstly**, this thesis describes a project based on observations of [Bok globules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_globule) which are small clouds containing a single or just a few star formation sites. The aim is to determine how these globules form, evolve and disperse. Observations were obtained using the [Omega Prime wide-field infrared camera](https://www.caha.es/CAHA/Instruments/IRCAM/OPRIME/OPrime.html) installed on the 3.5m telescope on [Calar Alto](http://www.caha.es/), Spain.

The results indicate outflow activity in several large globules and parsec scale outflows in two of them, namely *CB34* and *CB54*. In each case where outflows were detected, the distribution of reddened stars was also determined using JHK photometry. These results, combined with a careful literature review, provide sufficient confidence to construct a hypothetical evolutionary sequence for Bok globules, in which those that display outflow activity are assumed to be in a late evolutionary stage.

**The second part** describes a project designed to study examples of very bright outflows in the near-infrared using the UFTI high-resolution infrared imager installed on [UKIRT](http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/), Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The project aims to provide insight into the physics of outflows, with the further aim of identifying the characteristics of the main driving source. These results aid our understanding of parsec-scale outflows observed in Bok globules.

New measurements of the [HH 7-11 outflow](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.338...57K) allow a determination of the proper motions (`~40 km/s`) of the near-infrared sources, significantly lowering previously reported values but now in agreement with optical measurements. In addition to this dynamical study, a detailed investigation of the HH~7 bow is carried out using imaging with several near-infrared filters such as `[FeII]` and the `2-1 S(1)` line of `H_2`. In `[FeII]`, an elongated [Mach disk structure in HH 7](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.339..524S) is found while the `H_2` `S(1) 1-0/2-1` ratio reveals the excitation levels, which can be used to constrain bow-shock models. The results indicate that
motion at 30 degrees from the line of sight with `~55 km/s` velocity is required. I extend the study to other bright shocks, such as ASR 49 and those found in the [S233IR](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...418..163K) region.

**Finally**, the thesis [describes preliminary results](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...426..171K) from a new project on the *Rho Ophiuchus cloud complex*, also seeking to identify the presence of new outflows with the objective of gaining new knowledge concerning the cloud's formation and evolution. The aim is to conduct an unbiased search for shock-excited molecular hydrogen structures within the cloud and to relate them to identified protostars.

This work on Rho Ophiuchus is based on data obtained with the SOFI infrared imager installed on the [NTT](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/telescopes/ntt/overview.html), La Silla, Chile. A detailed map of over a quarter of the planned survey area was produced, which is 34 square arc-minutes in the `K` and `H_2` bands, confirming the presence of previously known near-infrared HH objects and also identifying new ones. The present sample of observed outflows in the Rho Ophiuchus cloud, however, is insufficient to draw definite conclusions since it remains
difficult to relate them to known YSOs in the cloud.

**In summary**, this investigation demonstrates that near-infrared wide-field studies of star formation "tracks", together with high-resolution studies, can yield significant clues to [the underlying driving sources](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...447..609S) and reveal the on-going physical interaction with their environments.
