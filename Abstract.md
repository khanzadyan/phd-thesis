# Abstract

In this thesis I present an investigation of the manifestations of the star-formation in different sites. It consists of 3 major parts, where each part describes observations, analysis and interpretation of different kinds of objects using the same technique of near-infrared imaging in order to account for interaction of outflows with the different kinds of environment.

**Firstly** it describes a project based on observations of [Bok Globules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bok_globule) containing single or a few star formation sites. Our aim is to determine how these globules form, evolve and disperse. For this purpose the sample of globules has been observed using the [Omega Prime wide-field infrared camera](https://www.caha.es/CAHA/Instruments/IRCAM/OPRIME/OPrime.html) installed on the 3.5m telescope, [Calar Alto](http://www.caha.es/), Spain.

We have detected outflow activity in several large globules and even parsec scale outflows have been observed in two of them – *CB34* and *CB54*. In all globules where we have been able to detect outflows the concentration of reddened stars has also been determined through JHK photometry. Our results and careful literature review give enough confidence to construct some hypothetic evolutionary sequence for the Bok Globules, where examples with outflow activity have been placed in the advanced evolved stage.

**Secondly**, it describes a project designed to study a very bright examples of outflows in the near-infrared using the UFTI high-resolution infrared imager installed on [UKIRT](http://www.ukirt.hawaii.edu/), Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The project aims to gain insight of outflow physics, which should help one to track down the characteristics of the source itself. And finally one can extrapolate this knowledge to parsec-scale outflows found in Bok Globules.

Observational results have enabled us to investigate the [HH 7-11 outflow](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.338...57K) and determine proper motions (`∼ 45 km/s`) in the near-infrared lower than it was reported earlier, which is now in agreement with optical measurements. Apart from the dynamic study, we pursued the anatomical study of the HH 7 bow in several near-infrared filters such as `[FeII]`, `2-1 S(1)` of H2. In `[FeII]` we found a [Mach disk like structure in HH 7](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.339..524S). Then, we have used the H2 `S(1)` `1-0/2-1` ratio to reveal the excitation level, which was complemented with bow shock model matching observations with 30 degree from line of site and `∼ 55 km/s` velocity. Further I extend the study to other bright shocks, such as ASR 49 and [S233IR](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...418..163K) region and obtain further results.

**Thirdly**, it describes the project which we have started on the *Rho Ophiuchus cloud complex* using our knowledge of cloud formation and evolution. The aim of the project is to do an unbiased search of H2 excited objects within the cloud and to relate them to present protostars. By doing so we then would be able to talk about the Star Formation mechanism in the cloud.

We have presented here the first results from our [near-infrared wide-field study of Rho Ophiuchus](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...426..171K) using the SOFI infrared imager installed on [NTT](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/telescopes/ntt/overview.html), La Silla, Chile. We have mapped only a part of the planned survey area, which is 34 square arc-minutes in J, H, K and H2 bands. As result of this search we have confirmed known near-infrared HH objects and have discovered new ones. Further study has been carried out to “connect” outflows with known protostars.

**Finally**, based on our investigation, we have shown and concluded that near-infrared wide-field study of star formation “tracks” combined with high-resolution studies of them can give very important clues on the whereabouts of the sources and [reveal the on-going physical processes in them](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...447..609S).
